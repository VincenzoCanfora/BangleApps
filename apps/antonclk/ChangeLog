0.01: New App!
0.02: Load widgets after setUI so widclk knows when to hide
0.03: Clock now shows day of week under date.
0.04: Clock can optionally show seconds, date optionally in ISO-8601 format, weekdays and uppercase configurable, too.
0.05: Clock can optionally show ISO-8601 calendar weeknumber (default: Off)
      when weekday name "Off": week #:<num>
      when weekday name "On": weekday name is cut at 6th position and .#<week num> is added
0.06: fixes #1271 - wrong settings name
      when weekday name and calendar weeknumber are on then display is <weekday short> #<calweek>
      week is buffered until date or timezone changes
0.07: align default settings with app.js (otherwise the initial displayed settings will be confusing to users)
0.08: fixed calendar weeknumber not shortened to two digits
0.09: Use default Bangle formatter for booleans
0.10: Use Bangle.setUI({remove:...}) to allow loading the launcher without a full reset on 2v16
0.11: Moved enhanced Anton clock to 'Anton Clock Plus' and stripped this clock back down to make it faster for new users (270ms -> 170ms)
      Modified to avoid leaving functions defined when using setUI({remove:...})
